# API documentation for the TURTLE library
( **T**opographic **U**tilities for t**R**ansporting par**T**icules over

## Description

This is an HTML documentation of the [TURTLE][TURTLE] library API. The [latest
build](https://niess.github.io/turtle-docs) is available from GitHub pages.
The documentation is automatically generated from a
[Docurium](https://github.com/niess/docurium) fork.

## Usage

Clone the present repository, e.g. as:
```bash
cd turtle && git clone https://github.com/niess/turtle-docs.git docs
```
Then one can navigate the local content by directing a browser to the
[docs/index.html](docs/index.html) file. Note that with some browsers, e.g.
chrome, you'll need to explicitly serve the file using a local HTTP server.
For example, using Python:
```bash
cd docs/docs
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then direct your browser to localhost:8000.
